# PredictingTheLifeAndDeathOfThoseOnTheTitanicTrain

Description: Based on the titanic dataset above kaggle with 12 data fields, we proceed to select the necessary fields to predict the probability of death of passengers on the titanic train by machine learning models.

- Use feature selection techniques to select key fields that affect the survival of people on the titanic train .
- Use empty data handling, exception handling, and data normalization techniques to increase model predictability .
- Apply machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression to predict
- Perform data visualization to get an overview of the accuracy between models
